    """Mapping half of the SLAM system (runs in its own process).

    The backend owns the Gaussian map and jointly optimizes, over the
    current keyframe window:
      - all Gaussian parameters (position, color, opacity, scale, rotation),
      - the poses of the newest `pose_window` keyframes,
      - the exposure (a, b) of every keyframe in the window.
    It also adds Gaussians for each new keyframe, densifies/prunes the map,
    and periodically sends a detached copy of the map plus the refined
    keyframe poses back to the frontend (push_to_frontend).

    It is driven by messages on backend_queue ("init", "keyframe", "pause",
    "unpause", "color_refinement", "stop"). When no message is waiting, it
    keeps optimizing the current window in the background (multi-thread
    mode only).
