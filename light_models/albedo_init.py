# Albedo of the Gaussians created for a new keyframe (docs/DECISIONS.md D7).
#
# Called by BackEnd.add_next_kf only when a shader is active; original MonoGS
# (shader None) keeps its own color initialization untouched.
#
# Every strategy has the SAME signature, rich enough for all three planned
# strategies so adding median_depth / rendered_depth does not change callers:
#
#   strategy(params, config, viewpoint, placement_depth, *, shader, render_keyframe)
#     params          - Light.init_albedo block minus `strategy` (validated by
#                       the strategy against its declared keys).
#     config          - full config (LightTracking: exposure, color space).
#     viewpoint       - the keyframe Camera: observed image, intrinsics, pose,
#                       tracked exposure_a/b.
#     placement_depth - (H,W) numpy depth used to place the new Gaussians
#                       (FrontEnd.add_new_keyframe): sensor depth, or for
#                       monocular a GUESS (flat plane, or rendered depth with
#                       outliers replaced and noise added). 0 = no Gaussian.
#     shader          - the active shader, to evaluate shading at a depth.
#     render_keyframe - zero-argument callable: render_pkg of the map at this
#                       keyframe BEFORE the new Gaussians are added, or None
#                       if the map is empty (first keyframe). Lazy, so
#                       strategies that do not need it cost no extra render.
#   returns (3,H,W) float tensor: LINEAR albedo per pixel, unclamped (values
#   above 1 are kept; see D1). GaussianModel samples it at each new
#   Gaussian's pixel.
#
# Why several strategies: for monocular the placement depth is a guess, and
# dividing the observation by the shading at a guessed depth makes the
# albedo wrong by the square of the depth ratio (inverse-square falloff).
