# G-buffer (see gaussian_renderer.render for the call contract). Selected by
# name with Light.shader.type and looked up in _REGISTRY, never by if/else at
# call sites (CLAUDE.md section 2).
#
# Contract: shader(gbuffer, viewpoint_camera) -> dict with
#   "radiance_linear": (3,H,W) predicted linear radiance (required);
#   any other key: an auxiliary per-pixel map (e.g. "light_valid",
#   "light_cos_nl") copied into render_pkg for the losses.
#
# Shader objects are handed to the backend and GUI processes, which are
# started with multiprocessing "spawn": they must be picklable, i.e.
# module-level classes, no closures or lambdas, and only CPU tensors.
#
# This module must not import torch at import time (config tests run without
# it); the colocated shader, which needs torch, is imported only when built.
